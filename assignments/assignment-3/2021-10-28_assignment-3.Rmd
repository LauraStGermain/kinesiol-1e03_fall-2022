    a) Fitts' model of skill acquisition \textcolor{maroon}{\textbf{[5 marks]}}
    b) Bernstein's model of skill acquisition \textcolor{maroon}{\textbf{[5 marks]}}

# Submission guidelines

Your answers to the homework assignment questions should be typed and submitted via Avenue as a **PDF** file. Late assignments will be penalized 20% per day.

The file you submit must include your last name, first initial, and student ID using the following format: `a3_last-initial_ID.pdf`. For instance, I would submit an assignment named: `a3_carter-m_3351871.pdf`. Files submitted in the wrong format (e.g., Microsoft Turd's `.docx`) **will not be marked**.

Be sure to submit your file to the correct folder. Files submitted to the wrong folder **will not be marked**. If you need to resubmit your file to the correct folder after the due date, it will be considered late.
