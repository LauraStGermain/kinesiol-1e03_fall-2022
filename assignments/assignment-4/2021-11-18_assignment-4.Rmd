# Questions

1. The Shea and Morgan (1979) experiment discussed in lecture involved a high interference (i.e., random; ACB ABC ACB) repetition schedule and a low interference (i.e., blocked; AAA BBB CCC) repetition schedule. Give an example of a medium interference repetition schedule \textcolor{maroon}{\textbf{[1 mark]}}. Explain why your example should be considered a medium interference repetition schedule \textcolor{maroon}{\textbf{[1 mark]}}.


2. Using information learned from the *Augmented feedback* lectures, how might augmented feedback in the form of knowledge of results also contribute to why a random repetition schedule is more effective for learning compared to a blocked repetition schedule? \textcolor{maroon}{\textbf{[2 marks]}}

<!-- 3. Bernstein (1967) stated that effective practice is a form of *"repetition without repetition"*. Explain this statement. \textcolor{maroon}{\textbf{[3 marks]}} -->


# Submission guidelines

Your answers to the homework assignment questions should be typed and submitted via Avenue as a **PDF** file. Late assignments will be penalized 20% per day.

The file you submit must include your last name, first initial, and student ID using the following format: `a4_last-initial_ID.pdf`. For instance, I would submit an assignment named: `a4_carter-m_3351871.pdf`. Files submitted in the wrong format (e.g., Microsoft Turd's `.docx`) **will not be marked**.

Be sure to submit your file to the correct folder. Files submitted to the wrong folder **will not be marked**. If you need to resubmit your file to the correct folder after the due date, it will be considered late.
