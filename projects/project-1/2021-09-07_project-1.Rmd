# Instructions

In recent years, the use of blog posts as a way to share scientific ideas has seen a resurgence. For this project, you will take on the role of *science blogger*; thus, the emphasis of this project is on written communication. **This project can be completed individually or with a partner**. Choose and complete one of the two options below for your blog post. Independent of which option you select, your blog post should:

- be 800 to 1200 words (excluding references)
- include at least 3 primary sources (i.e., peer-reviewed scientific journal articles)
- target undergraduate students as the intended audience
- should be readable and visually appealing

# Option 1: Fact or fiction blog post

Choose one of the topics from the list below and in your blog clearly answer whether the topic/statement is *fact* or *fiction*.

1. The "all-around" athlete (in more scientific terms a generalized motor ability)

2. Muscle memory

3. Perfect practice makes perfect

4. When sport commentators say "What reflexes!" after a goalie makes an incredible or unexpected save


# Option 2: Researcher spotlight blog post

Choose one of the motor behaviour scientists from the list below. Your blog post should include a brief biography of the scientist and a summary of their contribution to the field of motor behaviour.

1. Antoinette M. Gentile
2. Richard A. Schmidt
3. Janet L. Starkes
4. Timothy D. Lee
5. Gabriele Wulf
6. Digby Elliot
7. Joan N. Vickers
8. Richard A. Magill
9. Carolee J. Winstein
10. Karl M. Newell
11. Diane M. Ste-Marie
12. J. A. Scott Kelso
13. Sian L. Beilock

# Submission guidelines

Project 1 should be typed and submitted via Avenue as a **PDF** file. Late submissions will be penalized 20% per day.

If you complete this project individually, the file you submit must include your last name, first initial, and student ID using the following format: `p1_last-initial_ID`. For instance, I would submit a file named: `p1_carter-m_3351871.mp4` (or some other video file extension). 

If you complete this project with a partner, only one of you needs to submit the file. The submitted file must include both students' last name, first initial, and student IDs using the following format: `p1_last-initial_ID_last-initial_ID`. For instance, if Brad and I completed the project together and I was the one submitting for us, I would submit a file named: `p1_carter-m_3351871_mckay-b_5819286.pdf`.

Be sure to submit your file to the correct folder. Files submitted to the wrong folder **will not be marked**. If you need to resubmit your file to the correct folder after the due date, it will be considered late.
