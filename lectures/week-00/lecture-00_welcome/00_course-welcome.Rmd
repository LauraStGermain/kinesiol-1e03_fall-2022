# this course is about...

### how do we *control* motor skills?

### how do we *acquire* motor skills?

---

## What is motor control?

- the study of the **neural, behavioural, environmental, and synergistic** mechanisms responsible for human **movement and stability (posture)**

<ins>Example research questions studied by motor control scientists</ins>:

1. How do our many different systems collectively organize to accomplish a task?

2. How are reflexes involved in the control of movement?

3. How do people maintain their balance when spinning around?

4. How do humans match perceptual information to appropriate motor commands?

5. How and why does alcohol or marijuana affect movement control?

6. Why do most people find it difficult to pat their hand while rubbing their stomach?

---

## What is motor learning?

- the study of the **processes** involved in acquiring motor skills and of the **variables** that **promote *or* inhibit** such acquisition

<ins>Example research questions studied by motor learning scientists</ins>:

1. Are there recognizable stages in the process of skill learning?

2. How frequently should learners be provided with corrective feedback?

3. Is the use of mirrors in teaching skills such as dance effective for learning?

4. Should instructors demonstrate only how to perform skills correctly?

5. How can a therapist or coach estimate a client's potential for (re)learning a skill?

6. Should a performer focus attention on his or her bodily movement?

# So why study motor control and learning?

.footnote[Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9U8X6I1vow]

.pull-left[
- 600 muscles, 200 bones, hundreds of joints

- 1-3 degrees of freedom per joint

- multiple muscles cross joints

- non-linear force generators
]

.pull-right[
- mechanical interactions

- imperfect sensors (e.g., vision, proprioception, etc)

- cross modal integration

- our sensors are SLOW! (i.e., out of date)

## yet, our movements must be...

#### *fast, accurate, smooth*

#### *adaptable/flexible*

#### *relatively "automatic"*

#### *learned*
