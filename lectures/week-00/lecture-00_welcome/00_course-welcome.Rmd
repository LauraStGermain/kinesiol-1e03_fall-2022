# this course is about...

### how do we *control* motor skills?

### how do we *acquire* motor skills?

---

## What is motor control?

- the study of the **neural, behavioural, environmental, and synergistic** mechanisms responsible for human **movement and stability (posture)**

<ins>Example research questions studied by motor control scientists</ins>:

1. How do our many different systems collectively organize to accomplish a task?

2. How are reflexes involved in the control of movement?

3. How do people maintain their balance when spinning around?

4. How do humans match perceptual information to appropriate motor commands?

5. How and why does alcohol or marijuana affect movement control?

6. Why do most people find it difficult to pat their hand while rubbing their stomach?

---

## What is motor learning?

- the study of the **processes** involved in acquiring motor skills and of the **variables** that **promote *or* inhibit** such acquisition

<ins>Example research questions studied by motor learning scientists</ins>:

1. Are there recognizable stages in the process of skill learning?

2. How frequently should learners be provided with corrective feedback?

3. Is the use of mirrors in teaching skills such as dance effective for learning?

4. Should instructors demonstrate only how to perform skills correctly?

5. How can a therapist or coach estimate a client's potential for (re)learning a skill?

6. Should a performer focus attention on their bodily movement?

# Course outline

---

## Content-based learning objectives

1) Explain the distinction between behaviour that is goal-directed and behaviour that is not goal-directed.

2) Identify and describe different taxonomies used to classify motor skills.

3) List, explain, and calculate common variables used to measure motor performance.

4) Describe sensory systems that support human motor behaviour.

5) Compare and constrast different classes of control.

6) Describe processes underlying motor preparation and factors that inﬂuence preparation.

7) Describe and explain the interaction between attention and motor performance.

---

## Content-based learning objectives

8) Describe the relationship between speed and accuracy in aiming tasks.

9) Define and distinguish between the terms performance and learning.

10) Identify and describe different methods to assess motor skill learning.

11) Compare and contrast different models of skill acquisition.

12) Identify, describe, and compare different conditions of practice for learning.

13) Explain why some conditions of practice are more effective than other conditions.

14) Interpret, summarize, and discuss data from common tasks used in the study of motor control and learning.

---

## Skill-based learning objectives

1) Locate, synthesize, and critically appraise relevant research.

2) Differentiate scientiﬁc and non-scientiﬁc sources of information.

3) Develop effective strategies to work independently and collaboratively in small teams.

4) Successfully navigate unforeseen challenges as they arise through collaborative problem-solving.

6) Apply effective time management techniques to deliver required products on time.

---
