# Review from last lecture

## Motor skills are...

- goal-directed and performed voluntarily
- require movements of joints and body segments via muscular contractions
- need to be learned (or relearned)

--

<br>
### Motor skills...

- vs reflexes
- vs abilities
- vs movements
- == actions

---

## Four characteristics of motor skills

1. Motor equivalence

2. Motor variability

3. Motor consistency

4. Motor modifiability

# Any questions?

# Learning objectives

1. Identify and describe **a key challenge** for any theory of motor control.

2. Define and describe **different taxonomies** for classifying motor skills.

3. Apply **Gentile's 2-dimensional** taxonomy in relevant settings.

## We can .grey[classify] motor skills using .grey[1 dimension] and .grey[2 dimensions] systems

### 1D classifications

- **Size** of the musculature (or movement precision)

- **Temporal** predictability (or where task begins and ends)

- **Stability** of the environment

## Gentile's .grey[two-dimensions] taxonomy

.footnote[<sup>1</sup>Gentile 2000; Gordon et al. 2016 *In Memoriam: Antoinette M. Gentile (1936â€“2016)* (https://doi.org/10.1080/00222895.2016.1198193)]

- 1D systems **does not always** capture the complexity of many skills that a practioner must take into account when making decisions **instruction**, **practice routines**, or **therapy regimens**

- Gentile<sup>1</sup> proposed a 2D classification system based on **two general characteristics** of all motor skills:
  1. **The environmental context** an individual performs the skill
  
  2. **The function of the action** characterizing the skill

--

- There are multiple levels within each of these levels, resulting in **16 skill categories**

---

## Gentile's .grey[two-dimensions] taxonomy

### Environmental context

1. .black[REGULATORY CONDITIONS]: features of the environmental context to which movements must conform if they are to achieve the action goal

--

  - i.e., *the relevant environmental context features*

  - they regulate **spatial** and **temporal** aspects of the movement

--
  
  - **do not** refer to the characteristics of a person's movements **BUT** only to characteristics in the environment in which a skill is executed

---

## Gentile's .grey[two-dimensions] taxonomy

### Environmental context

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>2.</span> .black[INTERTRIAL VARIABILITY]: whether the regulatory conditions during performance are the same or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different from one attempt to perform the skill to another

--

  - is either **absent** or **present**
  
  - is **almost always** present when the environment is in motion
  
  - only time motion variability is absent from one trial to the next is when the motion is caused by a machine (e.g., treadmill)

---

## We can extended the 1D environmental context classification by including intertrial variability

]

---

## Gentile's .grey[two-dimensions] taxonomy

### Function of the action

1. .black[BODY ORIENTATION]: refers to whether or not the performance of the skill involves moving the body from one location to another

--

  - is either **body stability** or **body transport**
  
  - change in body location can be achieved either **actively** or **passively**
  
  - e.g., walking from point A to B would be active transport
  
  - e.g., moving from point C to D on a moving escalator would be passive transport

---

## Gentile's .grey[two-dimensions] taxonomy

### Function of the action

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>2.</span> .black[OBJECT MANIPULATION]: refers to maintaining or changing the position of an object

--

  - skills that **involve** object manipulation are **more challenging** to perform
  
  - must manipulate or control the object successfully **AND** make the appropriate postural adjustments to offset any imbalances created by the object
  
  - this will **interact** with the individual performing the action

## We can use .grey[Gentile's taxonomy] for at least .grey[3 key reasons] in real-world settings

1. **Evaluate** the learner's movement capabilities and limitations

2. **Select** a progression of functionally appropriate activities for a learner

3. **Record** the learner's progress
