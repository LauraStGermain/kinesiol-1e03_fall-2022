# Review from last lecture

## There are .grey[two basic control systems] that guide action

We have discussed two sources of information that help us control our actions:

1. Interoceptive information (e.g., touch, proprioception)

2. Exteroceptive information (e.g., vision)

<br>

.black[CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL]: a class of control in which, **during** the course of an action, feedback is **compared** against a standard (or reference) to enable an action to be carried out as planned

.black[OPEN-LOOP CONTROL]: a class of control in which **all** the information needed to initiate and carry out an action as planned is contained in the **initial instructions** to the effectors

---

## Feedback provides a means for .grey[achieving] control objectives

- *Our driving example again*:
  - Speed limit is 50 km/h
  - Your speed is 60 km/h
  - Error is -10 km/h (50 - 60)

- A common alternative term for closed-loop control is **error-correcting feedback control**

- Fundamental objective of this class of control is to **reduce errors to 0** or **as close to 0** as makes no practical difference

where:
- *a* = y-intercept

**One bit** = the amount of information needed to reduce the original uncertainty in half

## Understanding the .grey[parameters *a* and *b*] in the equation for Hick's Law

.pull-left[
The **y-intercept** (*a*) is the expected reaction time when no choice is required (i.e., simple reaction time task)

.center[

.pull-right[
The **slope** (*b*) is the expected increase in reaction time when the number of S-R alternatives is doubled

## .grey[Exceptions] to Hick's Law

- If stimulus is **tactile**
  - *Direct stimulus-response relationship*

- If response is a **saccade**
  - *Saccade toward targets are natural and biologically important*

- If **extended practice** is undertaken
  - *42,000 practice trials eliminated typical RT difference between 2- and 4-choice tasks*
