## Preshot routines .grey[may be] advantageous for multiple reasons

.center[
![:scale 55%](imgs/tee-shot.png)
]

- Psychological explanations such as **increased confidence**, **self-efficacy**, **positive outlook**, etc

- **Attentional focus** on **external** factors important to successful performance

---

## Focus of attention can be based on .grey[specific instructions] or be .grey[self-adopted]

.black[ATTENTIONAL FOCUS]: The information that a performer's attention (or consciousness) is directed at

- **Internal** focus of attention: Focus on information associated with the performer's **body**
  - e.g., "*Think about the timing of your hip rotation*"

- **External** focus of attention: Focus on information that is **external** to the performer's body

  - e.g., "*Think about the tennis racquet hitting the ball*"

## Explaining the .grey[external focus] advantage

.black[CONSTRAINED ACTION HYPOTHESIS]: **Consciously** controlling one's movements **constrains** the motor system, which **interferes** with **automatic** control process

- Focusing on the **movement effect** via an **external** focus allows the motor system to more **naturally self-organize**

<br>
.black[*Q: How could we test the predictions of the constrained action hypothesis?*]

- "Consciously controlling..."

- "...constrains the motor system...interferes with automatic control processes"

## Feedback can arise from .grey[within] the performer or come from an .grey[external] source

.black[INTRINSIC FEEDBACK]: Sensory information that arises as a **natural consequence** of performing an action
  - e.g., vision, proprioception, haptic, etc
  
  - also called **response-produced** feedback, **inherent** feedback, and **task-**intrinsic feedback

<br>
.black[AUGMENTED FEEDBACK]: Information about performing an action that is **fed back** to the learner by an **external** source to **supplement** (i.e., augment) the use of intrinsic feedback
  - e.g., from a coach, therapist, video-replay, etc

.black[FINELY GRADED]: Includes both a **magnitude** and a **direction**

--
  
.black[GRADED]: Includes only a **direction**
  - e.g., too slow, to the left
  
--
  
.black[BINARY]: Includes neither a **magnitude** nor a **direction**

## .grey[Paradoxical] properties of augmented feedback

<br>

.pull-left[
- Augmented feedback **can be essential** for motor learning

.black[BUT...]

- Augmented feedback **may not be essential** for motor learning

]

--

.pull-right[
- Augmented feedback **can enhance** motor learning

.black[BUT...]

- Augmented feedback **can hinder** motor learning
]

---

## Augmented feedback .grey[can be essential] for motor learning

- Some performance contexts **do not make critical sensory feedback available** to the performer or learner

- **Injury or disease** can affect the **integrity of the sensory pathways** needed to detect intrinsic feedback

- Although the necessary **intrinsic feedback is available** and the individual's sensory system is **capable** of detecting it, the individual is **unable to use** the intrinsic feedback

---

## Augmented feedback .grey[may not be essential] for motor learning

- Some motor skills inherently provide **sufficient** intrinsic feedback, rendering augmented feedback **redundant**

- Some performance contexts provide a detectable **external referent** that the performer or learner can use to evaluate the appropriateness of an action

- When learners are able to **observe fellow learners** that **are also beginners** practice a new motor skill

---

## Augmented feedback .grey[can enhance] motor learning

- Some skills do not require augmented feedback to learn them, **but** receiving augmented feedback can:
  - **accelerate** the learning or skill acquisition process
  
  - result in a **higher level of proficiency**

- In these situations, augmented feedback is **neither** essential or redundant

- E.g., learning a **difficult coordination** pattern like the 90 degree bimanual coordination pattern

  - Use of Lissajous augmented feedback

---

## Augmented feedback .grey[can hinder] motor learning

- Augmented feedback can result in a **dependence** on its provision

- This has a **negative impact** when that same augmented feedback is **not available** in a **test** situation

- The dependency is likely when there is **minimal** intrinsic feedback available or it is **difficult** to interpret and use

--

- The dependence is **likely** (but not guaranteed) when a learner receives:
  - **Erroneous** augmented feedback
  
  - **Concurrent** augmented feedback
  
  - **Frequent** augmented feedback

## The .grey[roles] of augmented feedback in motor learning

.pull-left[
.black[Informational role]
- **Guide** the learner to an appropriate movement solution 

- Facilitate **achievement** the action goal of the skill

- Emphasized in the **Guidance** hypothesis<sup>1</sup>
  - Feedback is both a **performance** and **learning** variable
]

--

.pull-right[
.black[Motivational role]
- **Encourage** the learner to continue striving toward a goal through continued practice

- Secondary or a **by-product** of informational role

- Emphasized in the **"OPTIMAL"** theory<sup>2</sup>
  - Practice context can put learners into a **virtuous** or a **vicious** cycle
]

---

## Conditions best suited for .grey[knowledge of results] and .grey[knowledge of performance]

.pull-left[
.black[Knowledge of results]
1. To **confirm** own interpretation of intrinsic feedback

2. **Unable** to determine the outcome from intrinsic feedback alone

3. **Motivate** oneself to continue practicing

4. Encourage **discovery learning** through **trial-and-error** problem solving

5. May promote an **external focus** of attention
]

--

.pull-right[
.black[Knowledge of performance]
1. When skills **must be** performed according to **specified** movement characteristics

2. Specific movement components that require **precise coordination** must be improved or corrected

3. The goal of the action is to produce a specific **kinematic**, **kinetic**, or **muscle activity** profile

4. Knowledge of results is **redundant** with intrinsic feedback
