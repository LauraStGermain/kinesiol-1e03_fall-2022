> Motor learning is a **set of processes** resulting from **practice or experience** causing **relatively permanent gains** in the **capability for skilled performance**.

---

## Motor learning is an .grey[umbrella term] but there are (at least) .grey[two] main types

.footnote[Krakauer et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.c170043)]

.black[SKILL ACQUISITION]: the processes by which an individual acquires the ability to identify an appropriate movement goal given a particular task context, select the correction action given a sensory stimulus and/or the current state of the body and the world, and execute that action with accuracy and precision

<br>
.black[SKILL MAINTENANCE]: the ability to maintain performance levels of existing skills under changing conditions

## We can observe .grey[7 performance characteristics] during the learning process

.center[
![:scale 85%](imgs/performance-characteristics.png)
]

---

## We need to rely on .grey[methods] that can separate the .grey[relatively permanent] effects from .grey[transient] ones

.black[Performance-learning paradox]
- a high level of performance in practice **does not** mean an individual has learned the task

- a low level of performance in practice **does not** mean an individual has not learned the task

- To avoid being a victim of this paradox, we must rely on performance in **retention** and **transfer** tests when making evidence-based recommendations

# Learning objectives

1. Identify and describe the **basic recipe** for a motor learning experiment/intervention.

2. Compare and contrast **retention** and **transfer** tests.

3. Compare and contrast **Fitts'** and **Bernstein's** models of skill acquisition.

## Pause, reflect

What are the phasess required for a motor learning experiment?

What phase(s) allow us to assess whether learning has occured?

## We must use .grey[retention] or .grey[transfer] tests to measure whether a skill has been learned

- Assesses the **permanence** or **persistence** of the skill

- Occurs after a period of **no practice** (rule of thumb is minimum of 24 hours)

- Are performed under a **common level** of the manipulated practice variable

- Include the **same task** as the pre-test and acquisition phases

.pull-right[.center[
.black[Transfer tests]]
- Assesses the **adaptability** or **flexibility** of the skill

## There are 3 main .grey[similarity] factors that can impact skill .grey[transfer]

.pull-left[
**Transfer** refers to the **gain or loss** in the capability to perform one task as a result of practice or experience **on another task**

We can classify transfer as:
- **Positive** transfer if it enhances performance in the other skill

- **Negative** transfer if it degrades performance

- **No** transfer if it does not affect performance

# Learning objectives

1. Identify and describe the **basic recipe** for a motor learning experiment/intervention.

2. Compare and contrast **retention** and **transfer** tests.

3. Compare and contrast **Fitts'** and **Bernstein's** models of skill acquisition.

Models of skill acquisition can help us recognize areas to focus on during practice and skill acquisition, retention, and transfer depend on many factors.
