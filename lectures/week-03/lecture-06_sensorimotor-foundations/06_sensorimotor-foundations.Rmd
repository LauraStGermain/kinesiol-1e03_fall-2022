2. Describe the **sensory receptors** in the skin that provide **tactile** information and those that provide **kinesthethic** and **proprioceptive** information to central nervous system.

3. Describe several procedures researchers use to **investigate the role of kinesthesis and proprioception** in motor control

## Sensory receptors .grey[respond] to stimulation

Sensory receptors in the human body respond to **four** basic kinds of energy:

1. **Photoreceptor**: primarily responsive to light

2. **Mechanoreceptor**: primarily responsive to mechanical energy
  - e.g., vestibular receptors, touch receptors

3. **Chemoreceptors**: primarily responsive to certain chemical substances
  - e.g., taste receptors, smell receptors

4. **Thermoreceptors**: primarily responsive to thermal energy

---

## Biological sensory receptors can be classified based on the .grey[origin of the stimulation] to which they primarily respond

1. .black[EXTEROCEPTORS]: respond to mechanical, chemical, thermal, or electromagnetic contact with the external environment
  - e.g., mechanoreceptors in the skin, photoreceptors, and olfactory chemoreceptors

2. .black[INTEROCEPTORS]: respond to stimulation produced by physiological processes within the body.
  - e.g., thermoreceptors within deep tissues that respond to the internal temperature of the body, mechanoreceptors in arterial walls, mechanoreceptors in the gut wall, and a variety of internal chemoreceptors
  
3. .black[PROPRIOCEPTORS]: respond to mechanical stimulation associated with the angular positions of joints, movement of joints, the orientation of body segments, tensions in ligaments, tendons and other connective tissues, muscle length, and changes in muscle length

---

## Reponses of individual sensory receptors may carry .grey[four different kinds of information] about their stimulation

1. .black[Information about stimulus **strength**]: the size of the receptor potential (and consequently the firing rate of the afferent axon) carries information about the strength of stimulation

2. .black[Information about the **timing** of stimulus]: the length of time for which the receptor responds carries information about the length of time for which stimulation is present

3. .black[Information about stimulus **type**]: due to its selectivity, when a receptor responds, its response carries the information that that type of stimulation is present

4. .black[Information about stimulus **location**]: a particular receptor is located at a particular place and responds to stimulation applied at that location

## Tactile information is .grey[critical] for dextrous behaviour

## The response of a sensory neuron .grey[declines] when the level of stimulation .grey[does not] change

.footnote[Fig: Tresilian 2012]

- Receptor potentials and the firing rates of sensory neurons tend to decline over time if the strength of the stimulation remains constant, a phenomenon called **sensory adaptation**

## Different types of cutaneous mechnoreceptive afferents have .grey[different receptive fields]

## Characteristics of .grey[skin stimulation] to which the cutaneous mechanoreceptors are .grey[thought most likely to be responsive]

- **Merkel disks**: sustained skin contact and pressure, slowly changing skin deformations (frequencies less than ~5 Hz)

- **Meissner corpuscles**: lateral movement, vibration and fairly rapid changes in skin deformation (~5 to 50 Hz)

- **Ruffini end organs**: sustained and slow changes in skin stretch or tension

- **Pacinian corpuscles**: high frequency vibration (~40 to 400 Hz), contact events and rapid skin deformations

---

## Tactile acuity is .grey[determined] by Merkel receptors

## Meet Patient GL

![](https://sites.google.com/site/sarlegna/_/rsrc/1341002803993/photos-and-videos/gl.jpg)
]]

.pull-right[
- GL was 27 years old when she suffered a first episode of acute polyneuropathy with a complete paralysis (including her respiratory muscles)

- A 2nd episode of extensive sensory polyneuropathy occurred 4 years later (April 1979). This episode selectively affected the large myelinated sensory fibers

- GL has complete loss of touch, vibration, pressure, and kinesthetic/proprioceptive senses (pain and temperature are present)

## The .grey[perception] of body movements and position

- Afferent signals generated by exteroceptors in response to the external stimulation is referred to as **exteroceptive afference**
  - contains information about external objects, substances, and events

- Afferent signals generated by somatosensory mechanoreceptors in response to internal stimulation is referred to as **proprioceptive afference**

--

- The perception of body position and movement from proprioceptive afference is called **kinesthesis**

- **Proprioception** is a general term for perception based on proprioceptive afference and includes the perception of muscular effort and force

---

## Muscle spindle afferent endings are sensitive to .grey[muscle length] and .grey[speed] of muscle lengthing

.footnote[Fig: Tresilian 2012]

.pull-left[
- The muscle spindle is **elastic** and is lengthened (stretched) or shortened as the muscle in which it is embedded lengthens or shortens

- Muscle spindles are innervated by **Type Ia** and **Type II** afferents

- An extrafusal fibre can typically generate 30 to 40 times as much force as an intrafusal fibre

## Golgi tendon organs are .grey[muscle force] sensors

.footnote[Fig: Tresilian 2012]

.pull-left[
- It is an encapsulated bundle of collagen strands innervated by afferent axons that branch into numerous fine terminals within the organ capsule and intermesh with the collagen strands

- Not actually located in the tendon but at the **junctions** between muscle and tendon

- The axons innervating tendon organs are referred to as **Type Ib** afferents

- Force will only be applied when muscle fibres are actively developing force

## Tendon vibration selectively stimulates .grey[Type Ia] spindle afferents and produces kinesthetic illusions

.footnote[Fig: Tresilian 2012]

.pull-left[
- The tendon deflection **stretches** the muscle very slightly but does so quite rapidly

- When frequency is high enough (20 to 100 Hz), the speed of stretching can be sufficient to stimulate Type Ia afferent endings

- Tendon vibration has been found to evoke **illusory** perceptions of **joint movement** if the person **cannot see the joint**

## Spindle information .grey[dominates] information from other proprioceptors

.footnote[Fig: Tresilian 2012]

.pull-left[.center[
![:scale 80%](imgs/pinocchio-illusion.png)
]]

--

.pull-right[
- Resolving a conflict between different sources of sensory information about a single perceived quantity by using one source and ignoring the other is called **sensory dominance**

- Recall that these kinesthetic illusions **depend on not having vision** of the joint

- Reveals how visions dominates the other sensory modalities whereas the other examples show how spindle afferents signals can dominate **within** a modality

## A limb can be .grey[felt] where it is seen and .grey[not] where it actually is

.footnote[Fig: Tresilian 2012]

.pull-left[.center[
![:scale 90%](imgs/rubber-hand.png)
]]

.pull-right[
- If illusion works, hand is felt where they see rubber hand (**visual capture of kinesthesis**) and refer their feeling of stroking to rubber hand (**visual capture of touch**)

.pull-left[
.black[Matching tasks]
- try to match position or movement of a body segment (the target) with something else
- another body segment or a moveable device
- can be **simultaneous** or **successive**

.black[Discrimination tasks]
- try to tell the difference between two or more situations
- e.g., set joint angles for right and left elbow, ask to judge whether left elbow is more flexed/extended
- can be used to establish the **discrimination threshold**
