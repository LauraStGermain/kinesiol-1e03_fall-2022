# Motor Control and Learning (KINESIOL 1E03 at McMaster University)

## Fall 2021 offering

The course is co-taught by Dr. Mike Carter (Motor control section - Sept 7 to Oct 21) and Dr. Brad McKay (Motor learning section - Oct 25 to Dec 2). Dr. McKay will be adding two new metascience lectures to KINESIOL 1E03 this year.

## Course description

Examination of the behavioural and psychological principles of motor control and motor learning. Topics include measurement of motor performance, sensory processes, perception, memory, attention, practice and feedback, and neuroscience fundamentals in motor control.

## Course material
There is **no** required textbook for this course. However, relevant chapters from Magill, R., & Anderson, D. (2017). *Motor learning and control: Concepts and applications* are listed as supplemental readings. 

You can access this textbook for free through the McMaster University Library: http://libaccess.mcmaster.ca/login?url=https://accessphysiotherapy.mhmedical.com/Book.aspx?bookid=2311. You will need to login using your MacID and password to access the textbook.
